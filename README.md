# Awesome Web-Based Urban Projections `[WBUP]` [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Each link below should be a functional and immediately projectable URL. What makes an awesome WBUP, for starters it should be considerate of projection as a medium. For example: keep in mind that this is not simply a web page. The WBUP has to live in a complex universe of potential public surfaces. Consider aspects like contrast, readability, glanceability and responsiveness.

For further details please refer to the [Doublespace](https://datainpublic.space/) project.

We would love to add more awesome WBUP examples, prototypes and tools. Please don't hesitate to submit a pull request to this file.
